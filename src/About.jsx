          In stark contrast to myself, Blog_Poggz2 authentically cares for those around around them. It is this caring that has paved the road they currently tread, though that path was once little more than an unmarked path. With humble beginnings, Blog_Poggz2 got their start working for the United Church of Pipton publishing updates in a monthly bulletin about new members, deaths, births, public events and other gossip - excuse me - news. As the Church grew, so did the little bulletin until it grew into a monthly magazine that encouraged Piptonites to keep up with the hithers and thithers of their city. The Pipton Times was born! But Blog_Poggz2 knew that there was so much more gossip - excuse me - news to be discovered, compiled, and spread around. They entrusted The Pipton Times to those in Pipton who wanted to carry the banner on and simply disappeared.

          Years passed without folx hearing from the once highly regarded reporter, but all along Blog_Poggz2 knew, "...this time, it has to be bigger, it has to be better, it has to be Fuzzbeed". At last, Blog_Poggz2 found the proper home for all their gossip - excuse me - news and now it was no longer restricted to a single space in time! It could be about anytime, anywhere, anyone! "Sharing is caring" is a phrase we all use but where did it come from? Who said it first. No one really knows, but we do know it was used in those first bulletins writen by Blog_Poggz2. Though it pains me personally to say, sharing is caring and that's what Blog_Poggz2 does best.
